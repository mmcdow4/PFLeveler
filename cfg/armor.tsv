244	0	Padded Armor	5 gp	1	8	0	5	30	20	10	More than simple clothing, padded armor combines heavy, quilted cloth and layers of densely packed stuffing to create a cheap and basic protection. It is typically worn by those not intending to face lethal combat or those who wish their maneuverability to be impacted as little as possible.
245	0	Leather Armor	10 gp	2	6	0	10	30	20	15	Leather armor is made up of multiple overlapping pieces of leather, boiled to increase their natural toughness and then deliberately stitched together. Although not as sturdy as metal armor, the flexibility it allows wearers makes it among the most widely used types of armor.
246	0	Studded Leather Armor	25 gp	3	5	-1	15	30	20	20	An improved form of leather armor, studded leather armor is covered with dozens of metal protuberances. While these rounded studs offer little defense individually, in the numbers they are arrayed in upon such armor, they help catch lethal edges and channel them away from vital spots. The rigidity caused by the additional metal does, however, result in less mobility than is afforded by a suit of normal leather armor.
247	0	Chain shirt	100 gp	4	4	-2	20	30	20	25	Covering the torso, this shirt is made up of thousands of interlocking metal rings.
248	1	Hide Armor	15 gp	4	4	-3	20	20	15	25	Hide armor is made from the tanned skin of particularly thick-hided beasts, stitched with either multiple overlapping layers of crude leather or exterior pieces of leather stuffed with padding or fur. Damage to the armor is typically repaired by restitching gashes or adding new pieces of hide, giving the most heavily used suits a distinctively patchwork quality.
249	1	Scale mail	50 gp	5	3	-4	25	20	15	30	Scale mail is made up of dozens of small, overlapping metal plates. Similar to both splint mail and banded mail, scalemail has a flexible arrangement of scales in an attempt to avoid hindering the wearer's mobility, but at the expense of omitting additional protective layers of armor. A suit of scale mail includes gauntlets.
250	1	Chainmail	150 gp	6	2	-5	30	20	15	40	Unlike a chain shirt, which covers only the chest, chainmail protects the wearer with a complete mesh of chain links that cover the torso and arms, and extends below the waist. Multiple interconnected pieces offer additional protection over vital areas. The suit includes gauntlets.
251	1	Breastplate	200 gp	6	3	-4	25	20	15	30	A breastplate protects a wearer's torso with a single piece of sculpted metal, similar to the core piece of a suit of full plate. Despite its sturdiness, its inflexibility and open back make it inferior to complete suits of metal armor, but still an improvement over most non-metal armors.
252	2	Splint mail	200 gp	7	0	-7	40	20	15	45	Splint mail is made up of overlapping layers of metal strips attached to a backing of leather or sturdy fabric. These splints are of greater size and durability than those that compose a suit of scale mail, improving the protection they afford the wearer, but at the cost of flexibility. A suit of splint mail includes gauntlets.
253	2	Banded mail	250 gp	7	1	-6	35	20	15	35	Banded mail is made up of overlapping strips of metal, fastened to a sturdy backing of leather and chain. The size of the metal plates, interconnected metal bands, and layers of underlying armor make it a more significant defense than similar armors, like scale mail or splint mail.
254	2	Half-plate	600 gp	8	0	-7	40	20	15	50	Half-plate armor combines elements of full plate and chainmail, incorporating several sizable plates of sculpted metal with an underlying mesh of chain links. While this suit protects vital areas with several layers of armor, it is not sculpted to a single individual's frame, reducing its wearer's mobility even more than a suit of full plate. Half-plate armor includes gauntlets and a helm.
255	2	Full plate	1500 gp	9	1	-6	35	20	15	50	This metal suit comprises multiple pieces of interconnected and overlaying metal plates, incorporating the benefits of numerous types of lesser armor. A complete suit of full plate (or platemail, as it is often called) includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4 100) gold pieces.
256	3	Buckler	5 gp	1	-	-1	5	-	-	5	This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you are using an offhand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed weapon), but you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off hand, you lose the buckler's Armor Class bonus until your next turn. You can cast a spell with somatic components using your shield arm, but you lose the buckler's Armor Class bonus until your next turn. You can't make a shield bash with a buckler.
257	3	Light Wooden Shield	3 gp	1	-	-1	5	-	-	5	This shield is strapped to your forearm and gripped with your hand when worn. Its weight allows you to carry other items in your shield hand, but you cannot use weapons with it. See shield, light in Table 6-4 for damage when sheild bashing.
258	3	Light Steel Shield	9 gp	1	-	-1	5	-	-	6	This shield is strapped to your forearm and gripped with your hand when worn. Its weight allows you to carry other items in your shield hand, but you cannot use weapons with it. See shield, light in Table 6-4 for damage when sheild bashing.
259	3	Heavy Wooden Shield	7 gp	2	-	-2	15	-	-	10	This shield is strapped to your forearm and gripped with your hand when worn. It is so heavy that you cannot use your shield hand for anything else. See shield, heavy in Table 6-4 for damage when shield bashing.
260	3	Heavy Steel Shield	20 gp	2	-	-2	15	-	-	15	This shield is strapped to your forearm and gripped with your hand when worn. It is so heavy that you cannot use your shield hand for anything else. See shield, heavy in Table 6-4 for damage when shield bashing.
261	3	Tower Shield	30 gp	4	2	-10	50	-	-	45	In most situations, a tower shield provides the indicated shield bonus to your Armor Class. As a standard action, however, you can use a tower shield to grant you total cover until the beginning of your next turn. When using a tower shield in this way, you must choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You gain total cover for attacks that pass through this edge and no cover for attacks that do not pass through this edge (see Combat). The shield does not, however, provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. You cannot bash with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else. When using a tower shield in combat, you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield's encumbrance.
262	4	Armor spikes	+50 gp	0	-	0	0	-	-	10	Armor spikes deal extra piercing damage (see spiked armor on Table 6-4) on a successful grapple attack. The spikes count as a martial weapon. If you are not proficient with them, you take a -4 penalty on grapple checks when you try to use them. You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. (You can't also make an attack with armor spikes if you have already made an attack with another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.) An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes' effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.
263	4	Locked Gauntlet	8 gp	0	-	0	0	-	-	5	Provides a +10 bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense to keep from being disarmed in combat. Removing a weapon from a locked gauntlet or attaching a weapon to a locked gauntlet is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The price given is for a single locked gauntlet. The weight given applies only if you're wearing a breastplate, light armor, or no armor. Otherwise, the locked gauntlet replaces a gauntlet you already have as part of the armor. While the gauntlet is locked, you can't use the hand wearing it for casting spells or employing skills. (You can still cast spells with somatic components, provided that your other hand is free.) Like a normal gauntlet, a locked gauntlet lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike. 
264	4	Shield spikes	+10 gp	0	-	0	0	-	-	5	These spikes turn a shield into a martial piercing weapon and increase the damage dealt by a shield bash as if the shield were designed for a creature one size category larger than you (see spiked shields on Table 6-4). You can't put spikes on a buckler or a tower shield. Otherwise, attacking with a spiked shield is like making a shield bash attack.
