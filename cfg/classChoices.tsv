533	6	7	Divine Bond: Bonded Weapon	5	1	0	NULL	NULL	NULL	Gain the ability to call upon a celestial spirit to enhance your weapon as a standard action for 1 minute per paladin level. The spirit causes the weapon to shed light like a torch. At 5th level the spirit grants the weapon a +1 enchantment bonus (for every 3 levels beyond 5th the weapon gains an additional +1 bonus). These bonuses stack with exiting bonuses to a maximum of +5 or may be used to add any of the following properties: axiomatic, brilliant energy, defending; disruption, flaming, flaming burst, holy, keen, merciful, and speed. Adding these bonuses conusme an amount of bonuses equal to their cost (Table 15-9) and are added to any properties the weapon already has (duplicate abilities do not stack). The bonus and properties granted are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. These bonuses are only in effect while held by the paladin. This ability may be used once per day at 5th level and an additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th. If a weapon bonded with the celestial spirit is destroyed the paladin loses use of this ability for 30 days or until they gain a level. During this 30 days the paladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.
534	6	7	Divine Bond: Bonded Mount	5	1	0	NULL	NULL	NULL	Gain the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed.

Once per day as a full round action you may magically call the mount to your side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin. This ability can be used once per day at 5th level and one additional time per day for every 4 levels above 5th. At 11th level the mount gains the celestial template (see Beastiary) and becomes a magical beast for the purpose of determining which spells affect it. At 15th level the mount gains spell resistance equal to the paladin's level +11. Should the mount die the paladin may not summon another mount for 30 days or until they gain a paladin level. During this 30 day period the paladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.
535	8	3	Combat Trick: Agile Maneuvers	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	2	You add your Dexterity bonus to your base attack bonus and size bonus when determining your Combat Maneuver Bonus (see Chapter 8) instead of your Strength bonus.
536	8	3	Combat Trick: Arcane Armor Mastery	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	6	As a swift action, reduce the arcane spell failure chance due to the armor you are wearing by 20% for any spells you cast this round. This bonus replaces, and does not stack with, the bonus granted by Arcane Armor Training.

539	8	3	Combat Trick: Heavy Armor Proficiency	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	9	See Armor Proficiency, Light.

542	8	3	Combat Trick: Bleeding Critical	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	14	Whenever you score a critical hit with a slashing or piercing weapon, your opponent takes 2d6 points of bleed damage (see Appendix 2) each round on his turn, in addition to the damage dealt by the critical hit.

543	8	3	Combat Trick: Blind-Fight	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	15	In melee, every time you miss because of concealment (see Chapter 8), you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit. An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however. You do not need to make Acrobatics skill checks to move at full speed while blinded.
544	8	3	Combat Trick: Blinding Critical	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	16	Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent is permanently blinded. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to dazzled for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. This feat has no effect on creatures that do not rely on eyes for sight or creatures with more than two eyes (although multiple critical hits might cause blindness, at the GM's discretion). Blindness can be cured by heal, regeneration, remove blindness, or similar abilities.
545	8	3	Combat Trick: Catch Off-Guard	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	18	You do not suffer any penalties for using an improvised melee weapon. Unarmed opponents are flat-footed against any attacks you make with an improvised melee weapon.

If you channel positive energy and you hit an undead creature, that creature takes an amount of additional damage equal to the damage dealt by your channel positive energy ability. If you channel negative energy and you hit a living creature, that creature takes an amount of additional damage equal to the damage dealt by your channel negative energy ability. Your target can make a Will save, as normal, to halve this additional damage. If your attack misses, the channel energy ability is still expended with no effect.
547	8	3	Combat Trick: Cleave	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	20	As a standard action, you can make a single attack at your full base attack bonus against a foe within reach. If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the first and also within reach. You can only make one additional attack per round with this feat. When you use this feat, you take a -2 penalty to your Armor Class until your next turn.
548	8	3	Combat Trick: Combat Expertise	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	22	You can choose to take a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class.

You can only choose to use this feat when you declare that you are making an attack or a full-attack action with a melee weapon. The effects of this feat last until your next turn.
549	8	3	Combat Trick: Combat Reflexes	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	23	You may make a number of additional attacks of opportunity per round equal to your Dexterity bonus. With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.

552	8	3	Combat Trick: Dazzling Display	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	32	While wielding the weapon in which you have Weapon Focus, you can perform a bewildering show of prowess as a full-round action. Make an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 30 feet who can see your display.
553	8	3	Combat Trick: Deadly Aim	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	33	You can choose to take a -1 penalty on all ranged attack rolls to gain a +2 bonus on all ranged damage rolls. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every +4 thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the bonus to damage increases by +2. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.
554	8	3	Combat Trick: Deadly Stroke	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	34	As a standard action, make a single attack with the weapon for which you have Greater Weapon Focus against a stunned or flat-footed opponent. If you hit, you deal double the normal damage and the target takes 1 point of Constitution bleed (see Appendix 2). The additional damage and bleed is not multiplied on a critical hit.
555	8	3	Combat Trick: Deafening Critical	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	35	Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, the victim is permanently deafened. A successful Fortitude save reduces the deafness to 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. This feat has no effect on deaf creatures. This deafness can be cured by heal, regeneration, remove deafness, or a similar ability.
556	8	3	Combat Trick: Defensive Combat Training	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	37	You treat your total Hit Dice as your base attack bonus when calculating your Combat Maneuver Defense (see Chapter 8).
557	8	3	Combat Trick: Deflect Arrows	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	38	You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon, you may def lect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to def lect a ranged attack doesn't count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects can't be def lected.
558	8	3	Combat Trick: Disruptive	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	41	The DC to cast spells defensively increases by +4 for all enemies that are within your threatened area. This increase to casting spells defensively only applies if you are aware of the enemy's location and are capable of taking an attack of opportunity. If you can only take one attack of opportunity per round and have already used that attack, this increase does not apply.
559	8	3	Combat Trick: Dodge	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	42	You gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC. A condition that makes you lose your Dex bonus to AC also makes you lose the benefits of this feat.
560	8	3	Combat Trick: Double Slice	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	43	Add your Strength bonus to damage rolls made with your off-hand weapon.
561	8	3	Combat Trick: Exhausting Critical	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	49	When you score a critical hit on a foe, your target immediately becomes exhausted. This feat has no effect on exhausted creatures.

564	8	3	Combat Trick: Gorgon's Fist	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	61	As a standard action, make a single unarmed melee attack against a foe whose speed is reduced (such as from Scorpion Style). If the attack hits, you deal damage normally and the target is staggered until the end of your next turn unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). This feat has no effect on targets that are staggered.
565	8	3	Combat Trick: Great Cleave	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	62	As a standard action, you can make a single attack at your full base attack bonus against a foe within reach. If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the previous foe and also within reach. If you hit, you can continue to make attacks against foes adjacent to the previous foe, so long as they are within your reach. You cannot attack an individual foe more than once during this attack action. When you use this feat, you take a -2 penalty to your Armor Class until your next turn.
566	8	3	Combat Trick: Greater Bull Rush	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	64	You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to bull rush a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Bull Rush.

569	8	3	Combat Trick: Greater Grapple	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	67	You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to grapple a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Grapple.

You only need to succeed at one of these checks to maintain the grapple.
570	8	3	Combat Trick: Greater Overrun	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	68	You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to overrun a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Overrun. Whenever you overrun opponents, they provoke attacks of opportunity if they are knocked prone by your overrun.

574	8	3	Combat Trick: Greater Trip	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	74	You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to trip a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Trip. Whenever you successfully trip an opponent, that opponent provokes attacks of opportunity.

576	8	3	Combat Trick: Greater Vital Strike	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	76	When you use the attack action, you can make one attack at your highest base attack bonus that deals additional damage. Roll the weapon's damage dice for the attack four times and add the results together before adding bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as flaming), precision-based damage (such as sneak attack), and other damage bonuses.

A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses. Dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.
601	8	3	Combat Trick: Mounted Archery	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	114	The penalty you take when using a ranged weapon while mounted is halved: -2 instead of -4 if your mount is taking a double move, and -4 instead of -8 if your mount is running.
602	8	3	Combat Trick: Mounted Combat	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	115	Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as an immediate action) to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Ride check result is greater than the opponent's attack roll.

This bonus to damage is increased by half (+50%) if you are making an attack with a two-handed weapon, a one handed weapon using two hands, or a primary natural weapon that adds 1-1/2 times your Strength modif ier on damage rolls. This bonus to damage is halved (-50%) if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon or secondary natural weapon. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every 4 points thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the bonus to damage increases by +2. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.
607	8	3	Combat Trick: Precise Shot	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	123	You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard -4 penalty on your attack roll.
608	8	3	Combat Trick: Quick Draw	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	124	You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a move action. You can draw a hidden weapon (see the Sleight of Hand skill) as a move action.

Alchemical items, potions, scrolls, and wands cannot be drawn quickly using this feat.
609	8	3	Combat Trick: Shield Master	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	126	You do not suffer any penalties on attack rolls made with a shield while you are wielding another weapon. Add your shield's enhancement bonus to attacks and damage rolls made with the shield as if it was a weapon enhancement bonus.

613	8	3	Combat Trick: Shatter Defenses	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	134	Any shaken, frightened, or panicked opponent hit by you this round is flat-footed to your attacks until the end of your next turn. This includes any additional attacks you make this round.

616	8	3	Combat Trick: Shield Slam	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	137	Any opponents hit by your shield bash are also hit with a free bull rush attack, substituting your attack roll for the combat maneuver check (see Chapter 8). This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Opponents who cannot move back due to a wall or other surface are knocked prone after moving the maximum possible distance. You may choose to move with your target if you are able to take a 5-foot step or to spend an action to move this turn.
617	8	3	Combat Trick: Shot on the Run	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	138	As a full-round action, you can move up to your speed and make a single ranged attack at any point during your movement.
618	8	3	Combat Trick: Sickening Critical	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	139	Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes sickened for 1 minute. The effects of this feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add to the effect's duration.

620	8	3	Combat Trick: Snatch Arrows	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	143	When using the Def lect Arrows feat you may choose to catch the weapon instead of just def lecting it.

621	8	3	Combat Trick: Spellbreaker	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	147	Enemies in your threatened area that fail their checks to cast spells defensively provoke attacks of opportunity from you.

You can move both before and after the attack, but you must move at least 10 feet before the attack and the total distance that you move cannot be greater than your speed. You cannot use this ability to attack a foe that is adjacent to you at the start of your turn.
624	8	3	Combat Trick: Staggering Critical	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	150	Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces the duration to 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. The effects of this feat do not stack.

625	8	3	Combat Trick: Stand Still	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	151	When a foe provokes an attack of opportunity due to moving through your adjacent squares, you can make a combat maneuver check as your attack of opportunity.

626	8	3	Combat Trick: Step Up	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	153	Whenever an adjacent foe attempts to take a 5-foot step away from you, you may also make a 5-foot step as an immediate action so long as you end up adjacent to the foe that triggered this ability.

A successful Fortitude save reduces this to staggered for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. The effects of this feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add to the duration.
629	8	3	Combat Trick: Stunning Fist	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	157	You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before your next turn). A stunned character drops everything held, can't take actions, loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a -2 penalty to AC. You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.

630	8	3	Combat Trick: Throw Anything	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	158	You do not suffer any penalties for using an improvised ranged weapon. You receive a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls made with thrown splash weapons.

633	8	3	Combat Trick: Trample	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	162	When you attempt to overrun an opponent while mounted, your target may not choose to avoid you. Your mount may make one hoof attack against any target you knock down, gaining the standard +4 bonus on attack rolls against prone targets.
634	8	3	Combat Trick: Two-Weapon Defense	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	164	When wielding a double weapon or two weapons (not including natural weapons or unarmed strikes), you gain a +1 shield bonus to your AC.

635	8	3	Combat Trick: Two-Weapon Fighting	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	165	Your penalties on attack rolls for fighting with two weapons are reduced. The penalty for your primary hand lessens by 2 and the one for your off hand lessens by 6. See Two-Weapon Fighting in Chapter 8.

637	8	3	Combat Trick: Unseat	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	167	When charging an opponent while mounted and wielding a lance, resolve the attack as normal. If it hits, you may immediately make a free bull rush attempt in addition to the normal damage.

638	8	3	Combat Trick: Vital Strike	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	168	When you use the attack action, you can make one attack at your highest base attack bonus that deals additional damage. Roll the weapon's damage dice for the attack twice and add the results together before adding bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as flaming), precision-based damage, and other damage bonuses. These extra weapon damage dice are not multiplied on a critical hit, but are added to the total.
639	8	3	Combat Trick: Weapon Finesse	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	169	With a light weapon, elven curve blade, rapier, whip, or spiked chain made for a creature of your size category, you may use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls. If you carry a shield, its armor check penalty applies to your attack rolls.
640	8	3	Combat Trick: Weapon Focus	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	170	You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls you make using the selected weapon.
641	8	3	Combat Trick: Weapon Specialization	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	171	You gain a +2 bonus on all damage rolls you make using the selected weapon.

645	4	1	Bonus Feat: Arcane Armor Mastery	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	6	As a swift action, reduce the arcane spell failure chance due to the armor you are wearing by 20% for any spells you cast this round. This bonus replaces, and does not stack with, the bonus granted by Arcane Armor Training.

647	4	1	Bonus Feat: Arcane Strike	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	8	As a swift action, you can imbue your weapons with a fraction of your power.

648	4	1	Bonus Feat: Heavy Armor Proficiency	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	9	See Armor Proficiency, Light.

Bleed damage can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal skill check or through any magical healing. The effects of this feat stack.
652	4	1	Bonus Feat: Blind-Fight	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	15	In melee, every time you miss because of concealment (see Chapter 8), you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit. An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however. You do not need to make Acrobatics skill checks to move at full speed while blinded.
653	4	1	Bonus Feat: Blinding Critical	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	16	Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent is permanently blinded. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to dazzled for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. This feat has no effect on creatures that do not rely on eyes for sight or creatures with more than two eyes (although multiple critical hits might cause blindness, at the GM's discretion). Blindness can be cured by heal, regeneration, remove blindness, or similar abilities.
654	4	1	Bonus Feat: Catch Off-Guard	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	18	You do not suffer any penalties for using an improvised melee weapon. Unarmed opponents are flat-footed against any attacks you make with an improvised melee weapon.
655	4	1	Bonus Feat: Channel Smite	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	19	Before you make a melee attack roll, you can choose to spend one use of your channel energy ability as a swift action. If you channel positive energy and you hit an undead creature, that creature takes an amount of additional damage equal to the damage dealt by your channel positive energy ability. If you channel negative energy and you hit a living creature, that creature takes an amount of additional damage equal to the damage dealt by your channel negative energy ability. Your target can make a Will save, as normal, to halve this additional damage. If your attack misses, the channel energy ability is still expended with no effect.
656	4	1	Bonus Feat: Cleave	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	20	As a standard action, you can make a single attack at your full base attack bonus against a foe within reach.

657	4	1	Bonus Feat: Combat Expertise	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	22	You can choose to take a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class.

661	4	1	Bonus Feat: Dazzling Display	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	32	While wielding the weapon in which you have Weapon Focus, you can perform a bewildering show of prowess as a full-round action. Make an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 30 feet who can see your display.
662	4	1	Bonus Feat: Deadly Aim	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	33	You can choose to take a -1 penalty on all ranged attack rolls to gain a +2 bonus on all ranged damage rolls. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every +4 thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the bonus to damage increases by +2. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.
663	4	1	Bonus Feat: Deadly Stroke	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	34	As a standard action, make a single attack with the weapon for which you have Greater Weapon Focus against a stunned or flat-footed opponent.

664	4	1	Bonus Feat: Deafening Critical	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	35	Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, the victim is permanently deafened. A successful Fortitude save reduces the deafness to 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. This feat has no effect on deaf creatures. This deafness can be cured by heal, regeneration, remove deafness, or a similar ability.
665	4	1	Bonus Feat: Defensive Combat Training	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	37	You treat your total Hit Dice as your base attack bonus when calculating your Combat Maneuver Defense (see Chapter 8).
666	4	1	Bonus Feat: Deflect Arrows	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	38	You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon, you may def lect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to def lect a ranged attack doesn't count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects can't be def lected.
667	4	1	Bonus Feat: Disruptive	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	41	The DC to cast spells defensively increases by +4 for all enemies that are within your threatened area. This increase to casting spells defensively only applies if you are aware of the enemy's location and are capable of taking an attack of opportunity. If you can only take one attack of opportunity per round and have already used that attack, this increase does not apply.
668	4	1	Bonus Feat: Dodge	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	42	You gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC. A condition that makes you lose your Dex bonus to AC also makes you lose the benefits of this feat.

If the attack hits, you deal damage normally and the target is staggered until the end of your next turn unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). This feat has no effect on targets that are staggered.
674	4	1	Bonus Feat: Great Cleave	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	62	As a standard action, you can make a single attack at your full base attack bonus against a foe within reach. If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the previous foe and also within reach. If you hit, you can continue to make attacks against foes adjacent to the previous foe, so long as they are within your reach. You cannot attack an individual foe more than once during this attack action. When you use this feat, you take a -2 penalty to your Armor Class until your next turn.
675	4	1	Bonus Feat: Greater Bull Rush	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	64	You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to bull rush a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Bull Rush. Whenever you bull rush an opponent, his movement provokes attacks of opportunity from all of your allies (but not you).

678	4	1	Bonus Feat: Greater Grapple	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	67	You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to grapple a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Grapple. Once you have grappled a creature, maintaining the grapple is a move action. This feat allows you to make two grapple checks each round (to move, harm, or pin your opponent), but you are not required to make two checks. You only need to succeed at one of these checks to maintain the grapple.
679	4	1	Bonus Feat: Greater Overrun	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	68	You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to overrun a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Overrun. Whenever you overrun opponents, they provoke attacks of opportunity if they are knocked prone by your overrun.
680	4	1	Bonus Feat: Greater Penetrating Strike	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	69	Your attacks made with weapons selected with Weapon Focus ignore up to 10 points of damage reduction. This amount is reduced to 5 points for damage reduction without a type (such as DR 10/-).

683	4	1	Bonus Feat: Greater Trip	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	74	You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to trip a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Trip. Whenever you successfully trip an opponent, that opponent provokes attacks of opportunity.

685	4	1	Bonus Feat: Greater Vital Strike	1	1	0	NULL	NULL	76	When you use the attack action, you can make one attack at your highest base attack bonus that deals additional damage. Roll the weapon's damage dice for the attack four times and add the results together before adding bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as flaming), precision-based damage (such as sneak attack), and other damage bonuses. These extra weapon damage dice are not multiplied on a critical hit, but are added to the total.
686	4	1	Bonus Feat: Greater Weapon Focus	1	10	0	NULL	NULL	77	You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls you make using the selected weapon. This bonus stacks with other bonuses on attack rolls, including those from Weapon Focus.
