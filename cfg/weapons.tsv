169	0	0	8 gp	1d4	1d6	x2	10 ft.	2	S		0	Throwing Axe	This is a small axe balanced for throwing.
170	0	0	1 gp	1d3	1d4	x2	20 ft.	2	B		0	Light Hammer	A lighter version of a warhammer, this weapon usually has a sleek metal head with one striking surface.
171	0	0	6 gp	1d4	1d6	x3		3	S		0	Handaxe	This one-handed axe is short (roughly 1 foot long) and designed for use with one hand. Unlike throwing axes, it is not well balanced for a graceful tumbling motion, and is instead heavier at its head. Tomahawks, war hatchets, and other such names usually refer to hand axes.
172	0	0	8 gp	1d3	1d4	18-20/x2		2	S		0	Kukri	A kukri is a curved blade, about 1 foot in length.
173	0	0	4 gp	1d3	1d4	x4		3	P		0	Light Pick	This weapon, adapted from the pickaxe tool, has a head with a slightly curved, armorpiercing spike and a hammerlike counterweight.
174	0	0	1 gp	1d4	1d6	x2		2	B	nonlethal	0	Sap	This weapon consists of a soft wrapping around a hard, dense core, typically a leather sheath around a lead rod. The head is wider than the handle and designed to spread out the force of the blow, making it less likely to draw blood or break bones.
175	0	0	24 gp	1d3	1d4	x3	20 ft.	3	P		0	Starknife	From a central metal ring, four tapering metal blades extend from this weapon like points on a compass rose. By gripping the crossbar that runs through the weapon's open middle, a wielder can strike with it as a deadly melee weapon. Alternatively, by gripping it by the outer rim, a starknife's light, aerodynamic design allows it to be thrown short distances in a manner similar to a chakram.
176	0	0	10 gp	1d4	1d6	19-20/x2		2	P		0	Short Sword	Short swords are some of the most common weapons found in any martial society, and thus designs are extremely varied, depending on the region and creator. Most are around 2 feet in length. Their blades can be curved or straight, single- or double-edged, and wide or narrow. Hilts may be ornate or simple, with crossguards, basket hilts, or no guard at all. Such weapons are often used on their own, but can also be paired as a matched set, or used in conjunction with a dagger or longer sword.
177	0	1	2 gp	1d3	1d4	19-20/x2	10 ft.	1	P or S		0	Dagger	A dagger has a blade that is about 1 foot in length.
178	0	1	2 gp	1d3	1d4	x3		1	P		0	Punching Dagger	A punching dagger's blade is attached to a horizontal handle that projects out from the fist when held.
179	0	1	5 gp	1d3	1d4	x2		1	P		0	Spiked Gauntlet	A guantlet outfitted with spikes.
180	0	1	5 gp	1d4	1d6	x2		4	B		0	Light Mace	A light mace is made up of an ornate metal head attached to a simple wooden or metal shaft.
181	0	1	6 gp	1d4	1d6	x2		2	S	trip	0	Sickle	A curved blade on a short metal handle, used as a farming implement to reap grain crops or cutting forage.
182	0	2	2 gp	1d4	1d6	x2		2	S	monk, trip	0	Kama	Similar to a sickle - and in some regions still used to reap grain - a kama is a short, curved blade attached to a simple handle, usually made of wood. It is sometimes also referred to as a kai, and is frequently used in pairs by martial artists.
183	0	2	2 gp	1d4	1d6	x2		2	B	disarm, monk	0	Nunchaku	A nunchaku is made up of two wooden or metal bars connected by a small length of rope or chain.
184	0	2	1 gp	1d3	1d4	x2		1	B	disarm, monk	0	Sai	A sai is a metal spike flanked by a pair of prongs used to trap an enemy's weapon. Though pointed, a sai is not usually used for stabbing. Instead, it is used primarily to bludgeon foes, punching with the hilt, or else to catch and disarm weapons between its tines. Sais are often wielded in pairs. When wielding a sai, you get a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder an enemy's weapon.
185	0	2	3 gp	1d4	1d6	x2		1	P	monk	0	Siangham	This weapon is a handheld shaft fitted with a pointed tip for stabbing foes. It resembles a (much sturdier) arrow with a grip designed for melee combat.
186	1	0	10 gp	1d6	1d8	x3		6	S		0	Battleaxe	The handle of this axe is long enough that you can wield it one-handed or two-handed. The head may have one blade or two, with blade shapes ranging from half-moons to squared edges like narrower versions of woodcutting axes. The wooden haft may be protected and strengthened with metal bands called langets.
187	1	0	8 gp	1d6	1d8	x2		5	B	disarm, trip	0	Flail	A flail consists of a weighted striking end connected to a handle by a sturdy chain. Though often imagined as a ball, sometimes spiked like the head of a morningstar, the head of a light flail can actually take many different shapes, such as short bars. Military flails are sturdier evolutions of agricultural flails, which are used for threshing - beating stacks of grains to separate the useful grains from their husks.
188	1	0	15 gp	1d6	1d8	19-20/x2		4	S		0	Longsword	This sword is about 3 1/2 feet in length.
189	1	0	8 gp	1d4	1d6	x4		6	P		0	Heavy Pick	This variant of the light pick has a longer handle and can be used with one or two hands. It is a common, inexpensive weapon for mounted soldiers since it can be used effectively from horseback.
190	1	0	20 gp	1d4	1d6	18-20/x2		2	P		0	Rapier	You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a rapier sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. You can't wield a rapier in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus to damage.
191	1	0	15 gp	1d4	1d6	18-20/x2		4	S		0	Scimitar	This curved sword is shorter than a longsword and longer than a shortsword. Only the outer edge is sharp, and the back is flat, giving the blade a triangular cross-section.
192	1	0	15 gp	1d6	1d8	x2	10 ft.	4	P	brace	0	Trident	A trident has three metal prongs at the end of a 4-foot-long shaft. This weapon can be thrown.
193	1	0	12 gp	1d6	1d8	x3		5	B		0	Warhammer	This weapon consists of a wooden haft and a heavy, metal head. The head may be single (like a carpenter's hammer) or double (like a sledgehammer). The haft is long enough that you may wield it one- or two-handed. Though heavy and relatively slow to wield, warhammers are capable of delivering immense blows, crushing armor and flesh alike.
194	1	1	0 cp	1d4	1d6	x2	10 ft.	3	B		0	Club	This weapon is usually just a shaped piece of wood, sometimes with a few nails or studs embedded in it.
195	1	1	12 gp	1d6	1d8	x2		8	B		0	Heavy Mace	A heavy mace has a larger head and a longer handle than a normal (light) mace.
196	1	1	8 gp	1d6	1d8	x2		6	B and P		0	Morningstar	A morningstar is a spiked metal ball, affixed to the top of a long handle.
197	1	1	1 gp	1d4	1d6	x2	20 ft.	3	P		0	Shortspear	A shortspear is about 3 feet in length, making it a suitable thrown weapon.
198	1	2	35 gp	1d8	1d10	19-20/x2		6	S		0	Bastard Sword	A bastard sword is about 4 feet in length, making it too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A character can use a bastard sword two-handed as a martial weapon.
199	1	2	30 gp	1d8	1d10	x3		8	S		0	Dwarven Waraxe	A dwarven waraxe has a large, ornate head mounted to a thick handle, making it too large to use in one hand without special training.Due to its size, a dwarven waraxe is an exotic weapon. A Medium character can use a dwarven waraxe two-handed as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. A dwarf treats a dwarven waraxe as a martial weapon even when using it in one hand.
200	1	2	1 gp	1d2	1d3	x2		2	S	disarm, nonlethal, reach, trip	0	Whip	A whip deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don't threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes). Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. Wielding a whip in two hands does not add 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier to damage rolls as with other weapons.
201	2	0	75 gp	1d6	2d4	18-20/x2		8	S		0	Falchion	This sword has one curved, sharp edge like a scimitar, with the back edge unsharpened and either flat or slightly curved. Its weight is greater toward the end, making it better for chopping rather than stabbing.
202	2	0	8 gp	1d8	1d10	x3		10	S	reach	0	Glaive	A glaive is composed of a simple blade mounted on the end of a pole about 7 feet in length.
203	2	0	20 gp	1d10	1d12	x3		12	S		0	Greataxe	This two-handed battle axe is heavy enough that you can't wield it with one hand. The head may have one blade or two, and may be bearded (meaning hooked or trailing at the bottom) to increase cleaving power and help pull down enemy shields. The haft is usually 3 to 4 feet long.
204	2	0	5 gp	1d8	1d10	x2		8	B		0	Greatclub	This larger, bulkier version of the common club is heavy enough that you can't wield it with one hand. It may be ornate and carved, reinforced with metal, or a simple branch from a tree. Like simple clubs, greatclubs have many names, such as cudgels, bludgeons, shillelaghs, and more.
205	2	0	15 gp	1d8	1d10	19-20/x2		10	B	disarm, trip	0	Heavy Flail	Similar to a light flail, a heavy flail has a larger metal ball and a longer handle.
206	2	0	50 gp	1d10	2d6	19-20/x2		8	S		0	Greatsword	This immense two-handed sword is about 5 feet in length. A greatsword may have a dulled lower blade that can be gripped.
207	2	0	9 gp	1d6	2d4	x3		12	S	reach, trip	0	Guisarme	A guisarme is an 8-foot-long shaft with a blade and a hook mounted at the tip.
208	2	0	10 gp	1d8	1d10	x3		12	P or S	brace, trip	0	Halberd	A halberd is similar to a 5-foot-long spear, but it also has a small, axe-like head mounted near the tip.
209	2	0	10 gp	1d6	1d8	x3		10	P	reach	0	Lance	A lance deals double damage when used from the back of a charging mount. While mounted, you can wield a lance with one hand.
210	2	0	10 gp	1d6	2d4	x3		12	P	disarm, reach	0	Ranseur	Similar in appearance to a trident, a ranseur has a single spear at its tip, flanked by a pair of short, curving blades.
211	2	0	18 gp	1d6	2d4	x4		10	P or S	trip	0	Scythe	This weapon consists of a long wooden shaft with protruding handles and a sharp curved blade set at a right angle. Derived from a farm tool used to mow down crops, a scythe requires two hands to use, and is unwieldy but capable of inflicting grievous wounds. Its connotations as a symbol of death make it an intimidating weapon.
212	2	1	5 gp	1d6	1d8	x3		9	P	brace, reach	0	Longspear	A longspear is about 8 feet in length.
213	2	1	0 cp	1d4/1d4	1d6/1d6	x2		4	B	double, monk	0	Quarterstaff	A quarterstaff is a simple piece of wood, about 5 feet in length.
214	2	1	2 gp	1d6	1d8	x3	20 ft.	6	P	brace	0	Spear	A spear is 5 feet in length and can be thrown.
215	2	2	60 gp	1d6/1d6	1d8/1d8	x3		15	S	double	0	Orc Double Axe	A cruel weapon with blades placed at opposite ends of a long haft, an orc double axe is a double weapon. Though invented by and traditionally associated with orcs, the double axe can be crafted and wielded by other races as well, though many disdain it for its extreme weight and clumsiness. Because of the blades at either end of the axe, the wielder must hold an orc double axe in the middle of its haft, and utilize a weaving, slashing fighting style more akin to that of a quarterstaff than to that of a greataxe or battleaxe.
216	2	2	25 gp	1d6	2d4	x2		10	P	disarm, trip	0	Spiked Chain	A spiked chain is about 4 feet in length, covered in wicked barbs. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon.
217	2	2	80 gp	1d8	1d10	18-20/x2		7	S		0	Elven Curve Blade	Essentially a longer version of a scimitar, but with a thinner blade, the elven curve blade is exceptionally rare. You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense whenever a foe attempts to sunder your elven curve blade due to its flexible metal. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an elven curve blade sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon.
218	2	2	90 gp	1d6/1d6	1d8/1d8	x2		10	B	disarm, double, trip	0	Dire Flail	A dire flail consists of two spheres of spiked iron dangling from chains at opposite ends of a long haft. This weapon excels at short but powerful strikes, and is typically swung in a constant churning motion. The wielder of a dire flail must have great strength, both to use the weapon effectively and to keep from tiring out.
219	2	2	20 gp	1d6/1d4	1d8/1d6	x3/x4		6	B or P	double, trip	0	Gnome Hooked Hammer	A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon - an ingenious tool with a hammer head at one end of its haft and a long, curved pick at the other. The hammer's blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (crit x3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (crit x4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. Gnomes treat hooked hammers as martial weapons.
220	2	2	100 gp	1d6/1d6	1d8/1d8	19-20/x2		10	S	double	0	Two-Bladed Sword	A two-bladed sword is a double weapon - twin blades extend from either side of a central, short haft, allowing the wielder to attack with graceful but deadly flourishes.
221	2	2	50 gp	1d6/1d4	1d8/1d6	x3		12	P or S	brace, double	0	Dwarven Urgrosh	A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon - an axe head and a spear point on opposite ends of a long haft. The urgrosh's axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other becomes the off-hand weapon. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part of the weapon that deals damage. Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.
222	3	0	75 gp	1d6	1d8	x3	100 ft.	3	P		0	Longbow	At almost 5 feet in height, a longbow is made up of one solid piece of carefully curved wood. You need two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. A longbow can't be used while mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a longbow. You can apply your Strength modifier to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow, but not a regular longbow. A longbow fires arrows.
223	3	0	100 gp	1d6	1d8	x3	110 ft.	3	P		0	Composite Longbow	You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular Strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow. For purposes of Weapon Proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.
224	3	0	30 gp	1d4	1d6	x3	60 ft.	2	P		0	Shortbow	A shortbow is made up of one piece of wood, about 3 feet in length. You need two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a shortbow while mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a shortbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow, but not a regular shortbow. A shortbow fires arrows.
225	3	0	75 gp	1d4	1d6	x3	70 ft.	2	P		0	Composite Shortbow	You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite shortbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular Strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is lower than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite shortbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow. For purposes of Weapon Proficiency, Weapon Focus, and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.
226	3	1	2 gp	1	1d2	x2	20 ft.	1	P		0	Blowgun	Blowguns are generally used to deliver debilitating (but rarely fatal) poisons from a distance. They are nearly silent when fired. For a list of appropriate poisons, see Poison.
227	3	1	50 gp	1d8	1d10	19-20/x2	120 ft.	8	P		0	Heavy Crossbow	Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a -4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two one-handed weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.
228	3	1	35 gp	1d6	1d8	19-20/x2	80 ft.	4	P		0	Light Crossbow	Loading a light crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a -2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.
229	3	1	5 sp	1d3	1d4	x2	20 ft.	0.5	P		0	Dart	Darts are missile weapons, designed to fly such that a sharp, often weighted point will strike first. They can be distinguished from javelins by fletching (i.e., feathers on the tail) and a shaft that is shorter and/or more flexible, and from arrows by the fact that they are not of the right length to use with a normal bow.
230	3	1	1 gp	1d4	1d6	x2	30 ft.	2	P		0	Javelin	A javelin is a thin throwing spear. Since a javelin is not designed for melee, you are treated as non-proficient with it and take a -4 penalty on attack rolls if you use a javelin as a melee weapon.
231	3	1	0 cp	1d3	1d4	x2	50 ft.	0	B		0	Sling	A sling is little more than a leather cup attached to a pair of strings. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls.
232	3	2	5 gp	1d3	1d4	x2	10 ft.	2	B	nonlethal, trip	0	Bolas	A bolas is a pair of wooden, stone, or metal weights connected by a thin rope or cord. You can whirl and throw this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a bolas.
233	3	2	100 gp	1d3	1d4	19-20/x2	30 ft.	2	P		0	Hand Crossbow	You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons.
234	3	2	400 gp	1d8	1d10	19-20/x2	120 ft.	12	P		0	Repeating Heavy Crossbow	The repeating heavy crossbow holds 5 repeating crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner as you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to use the reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts.
235	3	2	250 gp	1d6	1d8	19-20/x2	80 ft.	6	P		0	Repeating Light Crossbow	This weapon functions identically to a repeating heavy crossbow, except that its damage, critical, and range values are equivalent to those of a light crossbow instead of a heavy crossbow. Its significantly lighter construction and pull make it both more portable and more useful to those who rely on stealth or speed.
236	3	2	20 gp				10 ft.	6			0	Net	When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net's maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell. An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a DC 25 Strength check (also a full-round action). A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you. A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2 rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a non-proficient one to do so.
237	3	2	1 gp	1	1d2	x2	10 ft.	0.5	P	monk	5	Shuriken	A shuriken is a small piece of metal with sharpened edges, designed for throwing. A shuriken can't be used as a melee weapon. Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them and crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and of what happens to them after they are thrown.
238	3	2	20 gp	1d6	1d8	x3	80 ft.	3	B		0	Halfling Sling Staff	Made from a specially designed sling attached to a short club, a halfling sling staff can be used by a proficient wielder to devastating effect. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a halfling sling staff just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a halfling sling staff with one hand. You can hurl ordinary stones with a halfling sling staff, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls. A halfling sling staff can be used as a simple weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size. Loading a halfling sling staff is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. Halflings treat halfling sling staves as martial weapons.
239	4	0	1 gp					3			20	Arrows	Come in a quiver of 20. Usable with a longbow, composite longbow, shortbow, or composite shortbow. If being used as a melee weapon, treat it as a light imprrovised weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier x2).
240	4	1	5 sp					0			10	Blowgun Darts	
241	4	1	1 gp					1			10	Crossbow Bolts	Come in a case or quiver of 10. Usable with a light crossbow, heavy crossbow, or hand crossbow. If being used as a melee weapon, treat it as a light imprrovised weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier x2).
242	4	2	1 gp					1			5	Repeating Crossbow Bolts	Come in a case or quiver of 5. Usable with a light repeating crossbow or heavy repeating crossbow. If being used as a melee weapon, treat it as a light imprrovised weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier x2).
243	4	2	1 sp					5			10	Sling Bullets	Come in a leather pouch of 10. Bullets are shaped metal balls designed to be used by a sling or halfing sling staff.
